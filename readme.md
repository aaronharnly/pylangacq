PyLangAcq: Language acquisition research in Python
==================================================

What is this
------------

PyLangAcq is a Python library for the computational modeling of language acquisition. The library is under active development. The current version is 0.7.

As the CHAT format is used for conversation transcriptions more generally, researchers whose work is concerned with transcribed speech, conversation analysis, and other related areas will also benefit from this library.

Download and install
--------------------

PyLangAcq is currently available through GitHub:

    $ git clone https://github.com/pylangacq/pylangacq.git
    $ cd pylangacq
    $ python setup.py install

The command `python` is meant to be generic for whichever Python interpreter of your choice is. PyLangAcq is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.
