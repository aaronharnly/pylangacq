PyLangAcq: Language acquisition research in Python
==================================================

What is this
------------

PyLangAcq is a Python library for the computational modeling of language acquisition.

As the CHAT format is used for conversation transcriptions more generally, researchers whose work is concerned with transcribed speech, conversation analysis, and other related areas will also benefit from this library.

PyLangAcq is under active development. For full documentation,
